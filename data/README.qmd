This folder contains the datasets used in the analyses. The three main files of the terri4sol soil database are: 

- `soil_0.2.2.csv` contains soil measurements for each site, plot and soil depth (1: 0-10 cm, 2: 10-20 cm, 3: 20-30 cm);

- `use_0.2.2.csv` describes landuses in each plot over different periods of time (from `Starting_date` to `End_date`);

- `plot_0.2.2.csv` provides plot-level information. 

The `download` folder contains files that are downloaded with the codes in this repository.

The `cache` folder contains intermediate data files created during analysis.
